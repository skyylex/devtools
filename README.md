# devtools
Tools which I use in my day-to-day work as iOS software engineer

### Console

- **Terminal**. Usual OS X terminal brings all required functionality (for me).
- **Homebrew**. Great replacement for missing package repo in OSX.

### Design / Image assets

- **Photoshop**. As an open-source fan I've tried also to use GIMP, but it unfortunately not fully compatible with Photoshop files, which is a standard for UX/UI designers currently)
- **Retinize It. Actions** - Excellent set of photoshop actions for scaling .psd documents quickly - http://retinize.it
