# devtools
Tools which I use in my day-to-day work as iOS software engineer

### Text

- **Sublime**. Really great tool for text editing, and I think the best tool as of performance point. Atom doesn't have such power to open big files without app freezing.

### Console

- **Terminal**. Usual OS X terminal brings all required functionality (enough for my personal requirements).
- **Homebrew**. Great replacement for missing package repo in OSX.
- **rbenv**. Required part for cocoapods, system ruby on Mac is dead. Simple and functional enough, actually there is also RVM, but I can not compare them, because I didn't try RVM.
- **nano**. Simple standard console text editor.
- **fastlane**. Unique complilation of the tools for automatization and
- **cocoapods**. Usually the simplest way to control dependencies. Great community and support.
- **carthage**. More accurate solution from engineering point of view (doesn't change project sources). Personally I prefer Carthage over Cocoapods, but sometimes it's very tricky to make it working for specific frameworks.

### Design / Image assets

- **Photoshop**. As an open-source fan I've tried also to use GIMP, but it unfortunately not fully compatible with Photoshop files, which is a standard for UX/UI designers currently)
- **Retinize It. Actions** - Excellent set of photoshop actions for scaling .psd documents quickly - http://retinize.it

### Version control system

- **Git**. When I have a choice for version control, I prefer to use git. It's very popular (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket), it's open-source and it's predictable and stable. And it has tons of features for more advanced use.
- **SourceTree**. - Mostly I use git in CLI, but sometimes it's convinient way to see git repo as tree in UI, console options doesn't look so good.
